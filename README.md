# John Smilga Youtube Node.js Tutorial

* To instal and manage the packages package.json is needed.
* npm init -y or yarn init -y
* To add a package: npm i package_name
* To add as a dev dependency: npm i package_name -D
* We need the nodemon package to keep tracking changing without type node app.js everytime.
* npm uninstall package_name to remove a package
* Or you can do:
  * deletenode_modules
  * delete package-lock.json
  * delete package name's from package.json
  * npm i
